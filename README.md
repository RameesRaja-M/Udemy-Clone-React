# Udemy Clone – Homepage

**Excited to Share My Latest Project:** A responsive Udemy Clone homepage built as a front-end development project using modern web technologies.

## Project Overview

This project replicates the homepage of Udemy, a popular online learning platform, focusing on layout, responsiveness, and interactive components. It allowed me to explore best practices in React, modular design, and UI/UX principles.
